# Infinite Number Generator  

This is a simple and fun project designed to generate an infinite sequence of numbers. Perfect for testing, learning, or just satisfying your curiosity about endlessly counting numbers!  

## Features  

- **Endless Number Generation**: Produces an infinite stream of numbers starting from 1 (or any specified starting point).  
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Runs smoothly with minimal resources.  
- **Customizable**: Easily adjustable to modify step intervals, starting points, or other configurations.  

## Use Cases  

- Testing the limits of your system or software.  
- Exploring the concept of infinite loops and number sequences.  
- Having fun watching numbers grow endlessly.  

## Getting Started  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```  

2. Run the program:  
   ```bash
   python infinite_number_generator.py
   ```  

3. Watch the numbers grow!  

## Example  

Running the generator outputs:  
```
1 * 1 is 1
1 * 2 is 2
etc 
```  

(Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the program!)  

## Customization  

Feel free to tweak the code to:  
- Change the interval between numbers (e.g., count by 2s, 5s, etc.).  
- Add other features like pausing or saving the sequence.  

## Why I Made This  

This project was created just for fun, inspired by the simple joy of watching numbers grow infinitely. Sometimes, coding for fun is the best way to learn and experiment!
